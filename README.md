# Handwritten Digits Classification using Neural Network
This code implements both regularized and unregularized simple convolutional neural network to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 - 9) from the MNIST dataset. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, 0 - 9. Each image is 28Ã—28 pixels in size with only a single channel. It also includes labels for each example, a number indicating the actual digit (0 - 9) handwritten in that image. 

The following shows some example images from the MNIST dataset:
